# Statuses

In this directory another directory named `sample` can be found. `cd` into it and use the `git status` command to determine:
- changes to which files are added to the index
- changes to which tracked files are NOT added to the index
- the number of untracked files

After you've determined that, write the following in `answer`:
- On the first line, write the number of changes added to the index
- On the second line, write the number of changes that are tracked, but not added to the index
- On the third line, write the number of untracked files

## Example `answer`:
```
1
2
3
```

## Testing the solution
To test your answer, run the following command:
```sh
./test.sh
```
