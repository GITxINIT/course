### What is this?
- A 4 part course in git.

### Who is this course for?
- For (pre)junior level devs who are preparing for their first job
- For devs who would like to have strong git fundamentals
- For people who enjoy learning not only by reading, but also by doing
- For people who would like to see some cool git hacks
- For the team that's developing this course (it's fun)

### Who is this course not for?
- If you're a git wiz, you probably won't learn a lot. You might enjoy contributing to the course though.
- People not interested in learning git (duh)

### What does this course aim to do?
- Provide a clear, directed and easy-to-follow introduction to using git via the command line, without dumbing things down.
- Help participants make their lives easier with git, not harder.
- Challenge the participants with problems, to solution to which will require use and practice of git commands that are useful and necessary in the day-to-day work of a developer using git.
- Aid the participants in discovering why git is so widely used, what are it's strengths and how it's applied to software development.
- Explore software development at a larger and/or corporate scale, so students would be better prepared for their first developer position.
- Expose participants to a bit of shell scripting and automation :)
- I have definetely missed something

This repository will eventually contain all materials that will be used in an upcoming git course. This will include:
- Slides/notes
- Examples
- Problems (a part of them with automated feedback) and solutions
- A couple multiple choice tests
