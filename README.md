- For the team that's developing this course (it's fun)

### Who is this course not for?
- If you're a git guru, you probably won't learn much new with regard to the technical side. However, you might enjoy to contribute :)

### What does this course aim to do?
- Provide a clear, directed and easy-to-follow introduction to using git via the command line, without dumbing things down.
- Help participants make their lives easier with git, not harder.
- Challenge the participants with problems, to solution to which will require use and practice of git commands that are useful and necessary in the day-to-day work of a developer using git.
- Aid the participants in discovering why git is so widely used, what are it's strengths, in what waysit's used for software development.
- Explore software development at a larger and/or corporate scale, so students would be better prepared for their first developer position.
- Expose participants to a bit of shell scripting and automation :)
- I have definetely missed something
