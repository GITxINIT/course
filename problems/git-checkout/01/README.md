# Partial checkout

# Description
Clone `https://github.com/GITxINIT/maze-game` and checkout the branch `dev/update-styles`.

Imagine you're working on improving the styles in that branch, but you're using a chrome-based browser to test your solution. However, chrome refuses to load the webworker code from the file system. This has already been fixed in the master branch in the `js/main.js` file.

Bring only the changes to that file from the `master` branch in the current working directory. Look up how to check out only specific files from another branch and check out only the contents of `js/main.js` from `master`.
